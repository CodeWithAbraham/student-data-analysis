## Project Summary
This project analyzes a student performance dataset to explore how engagement and attendance levels affect GPA. 
Using Python and pandas, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to calculate key metrics such as 
average GPA by engagement level and attendance trends. Results revealed that higher engagement is associated 
with better academic performance. The processed data and summary were exported to `output.xlsx`.
