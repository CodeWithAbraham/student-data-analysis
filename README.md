## Project Summary
This project analyzes student performance data to examine how engagement and attendance relate to GPA. Using Pandas for data processing and NumPy for numerical analysis, new features were created to categorize engagement and attendance levels. The results show that students with higher engagement and better attendance tend to achieve stronger GPAs. The cleaned and processed dataset was exported to output.xlsx.
